# To run the project, follow these steps:

### Install dependencies:
npm install

### Start the development server:
npm run dev

# API Error Handling
To test the error-handling capabilities of the project, intentionally make the URLs in the hooks folders invalid. This will trigger the error-handling logic and allow you to see how the application responds to API failures.

#  TailwindCSS Usage
Many of the TailwindCSS classes in this project are generated or copied from external sources.

# Development Notes
This project was developed locally, and unfortunately, I realized too late that having a proper commit history would be helpful. Apologies for the lack of versioning.

# Areas for Improvement
I am aware of several possible code improvements that I did not have enough time to implement. I am open to discussion!
